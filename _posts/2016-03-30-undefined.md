**_What is human trafficking? _**  
**_Global fact:_**

Human trafficking has truly become a global threat to vulnerable men, women, and children worldwide. It is an injustice that affects millions of people every year on every continent and at all socioeconomic levels.

Human trafficking is a highly-organized and lucrative business, generating close to 32 billion USD per year.The latest global estimate according to the International Labor Organization (the United Nations agency that deals with global labor issues), calculates that nearly 21 million people are victims of human trafficking worldwide. Roughly 4.5 million of those victims are trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.

The most significant number of victims are said to come from Asia and the Pacific region, although human trafficking in Africa continues to grow when compared to its 2005 estimates. The International Labor Organization also estimates that 55 percent of all trafficking victims and 98 percent of sex trafficking victims are women and girls.

**_Local fact:_**

Illinois has the fifth largest number of human trafficking cases, following New York, Florida, Texas and California, according to a new study by the Polaris Project, a national organization that fights human trafficking, including bonded labor and involuntary domestic servitude.
